# BookmarkBot # 
A simple discord bot written in C# and using [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus), [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore), [EF Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) and [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
It uses [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) for easy and simple deployment.
I made it to prepare myself for making a more complex and actually useful bot.

## Features ##
* Bookmark messages using `b/add` or by reacting with :bookmark:. `b/remove` does the opposite.
* View bookmarks using `b/list` and filter them by server, channel and user. It includes a compact and non-compact mode as well as a very crude pagination system.
* `b/invite` and `b/status` commands.

## How to use
